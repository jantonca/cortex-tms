# Security updates are handled automatically regardless of schedule
# Dependabot will create PRs immediately for security vulnerabilities

# Benefits:
# - Automatic security patches
# - Grouped minor/patch updates (less PR noise)
# - Separate major updates (need review)
# - Consistent commit message format
# - Weekly cadence matches sprint cycles
# - Reviewers automatically assigned
