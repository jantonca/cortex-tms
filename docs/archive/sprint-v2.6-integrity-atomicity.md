## 🎯 Achievements

### TMS-265a (Sync Engine Expansion) - ✅ Complete (1h)
- Implemented glob-based file discovery system
- Expanded coverage from 3 to 29 files (860% increase)
- Synchronized 26 files from v2.3.0/v2.4.1 → v2.5.0
- Added `glob@11.0.0` dependency
- All validation passing: `docs:check`, `migrate`, `validate --strict`

### TMS-265b (Integrity Verification) - ✅ Complete (30min)
- Comprehensive validation suite (4 checks: sync, migrate, validate, example app)
- Documented v2.6 roadmap with progress tracking
- Established baseline: 100% synchronized, 0 drift detected

### TMS-267 (Example App Integrity) - ✅ Complete (30min)
- Added version tags to 3 Example App markdown files
- Expanded sync coverage from 29 to 32 files
- Verified tech stack current (Next.js 16.1.1, React 19.2.3, Tailwind 4)
- 100% of TMS files now tracked

### TMS-264 (Atomic Release Engine) - ✅ Complete (4h)
- Built class-based release engine (499 LOC)
- 6-phase lifecycle: preflight → backup → sync → git → publish → cleanup
- Pre-flight validation (credentials, workspace, branch)
- Automatic backup + rollback on failure
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- NPM scripts: `release`, `release:patch`, `release:minor`, `release:major`, `release:dry-run`

### TMS-260 (Git Guardian + Husky) - ✅ Complete (1.5h)
- Implemented "Doors vs Walls" pre-commit hooks (308 LOC)
- Code Guardian: Strictly blocks .ts/.js/.json commits to main
- Doc Guardian: Warns about .md commits to main (allows with guidance)
- Bypass mechanism: BYPASS_GUARDIAN=true with audit logging
- File categorization: code vs docs vs config
- Comprehensive error messages with 3-step fix instructions
- Audit trail in .guardian-bypass.log (gitignored)
- Installed Husky 9.1.7 for Git hook management
- Fail-safe design (allows commit if guardian errors)
- Silent on feature branches (zero friction)

### TMS-266 (Emergency Hotfix Path) - ✅ Complete (1h)
- Built lightweight hotfix script (298 LOC)
- Quick commit workflow for urgent doc fixes
- Validates main branch and docs-only changes
- Blocks code files (safety check)
- Uses BYPASS_GUARDIAN internally (no manual env var needed)
- Optional auto-push to remote (--push flag)
- Comprehensive help system (--help)
- NPM script: `release:hotfix`

## ✅ Validation Results

**Comprehensive Health Check** - All systems passing

```bash
# 1. Version Sync Check
$ pnpm run docs:check
✅ All 32 files synchronized with v2.5.0

# 2. Migration Health
$ cortex-tms migrate
✅ 9 files up-to-date
✅ 0 files outdated
⚠️  1 file customized (copilot-instructions.md - expected)

# 3. Project Validation
$ cortex-tms validate --strict
✅ All 11 checks passed
✅ Mandatory files present
✅ Configuration valid
✅ Archive status healthy

# 4. Example App Status
✅ 12 markdown files with version tags
