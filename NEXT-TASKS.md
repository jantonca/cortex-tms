### 📋 Next Steps

1. Build Emergency Hotfix Path command (TMS-266) - 1h
2. Complete v2.6 sprint retrospective
3. Plan v2.7 objectives

### ✅ Validation Results (TMS-265b)

**Comprehensive Health Check** - All systems passing

```bash
# 1. Version Sync Check
$ pnpm run docs:check
✅ All 29 files synchronized with v2.5.0

# 2. Migration Health
$ cortex-tms migrate
✅ 9 files up-to-date
✅ 0 files outdated
⚠️  1 file customized (copilot-instructions.md - expected)

# 3. Project Validation
$ cortex-tms validate --strict
✅ All 11 checks passed
✅ Mandatory files present
✅ Configuration valid
✅ Archive status healthy

# 4. Example App Status
✅ 4 markdown files detected
⚠️  0 version tags (TMS-267 pending)
```

**Integrity Status**: 100% synchronized | 0 drift detected | Production ready
