Welcome to the Cortex TMS blog! This is where we'll share insights, updates, and stories about building better software with AI agents.

## What to Expect

We'll be covering topics like:

- **AI-Powered Development**: How to work effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
- **Documentation Patterns**: Best practices for keeping documentation in sync with code
- **Project Governance**: Preventing "zero drift" and maintaining architectural consistency
- **Real-World Case Studies**: How teams use Cortex TMS to ship faster with AI

## Coming Soon

We're launching Guardian, an AI-powered code review tool that catches architectural violations before they reach production. Stay tuned for deep dives on:

- How Guardian prevents the "AI PR Tsunami" problem
- Pattern-based code review vs traditional linting
- Building with LLMs: Lessons from shipping Guardian MVP
