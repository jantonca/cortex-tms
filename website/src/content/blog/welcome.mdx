Welcome to the Cortex TMS blog! This is where we'll share insights, updates, and stories about building better software with AI agents. Whether you're shipping your first AI-powered project or scaling an entire platform with Claude Code, you're in the right place.

## What to Expect

We're here to help you navigate the new frontier of AI-assisted development. Here's what we'll be covering:

- **AI-Powered Development**: How to work effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot without losing control
- **Documentation Patterns**: Best practices for keeping documentation in sync with code as your project evolves
- **Project Governance**: Preventing "zero drift" and maintaining architectural consistency across teams
- **Real-World Case Studies**: How teams use Cortex TMS to ship faster with AI while maintaining quality

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Start">
New to Cortex TMS? Install it in seconds and see immediate token savings:

```bash
npm install -g cortex-tms
cortex init my-project
cortex status --tokens
```

Watch your context costs drop by 60-94% instantly.
</Callout>

## Coming Soon: Guardian

We're launching Guardian, an AI-powered code review tool that catches architectural violations before they reach production. It's like having a senior architect review every PR, but instant and pattern-aware.

<Terminal title="guardian-demo.sh" language="bash">
# Preview Guardian in safe mode
npx cortex-tms review src/ --safe

🛡️ Guardian: Semantic Validation
✓ Pattern compliance verified
✓ Safe Mode: No file operations executed
✓ 0 violations found

# Run Guardian validation
npx cortex-tms review src/commands/ --strict

📊 Analysis Complete
  ✓ 12 files scanned
  ✓ All patterns compliant
  ⚡ 0.8s execution time
</Terminal>

Stay tuned for deep dives on:

1. **Preventing the "AI PR Tsunami" Problem** - How Guardian stops bad AI-generated code before merge
2. **Pattern-Based Code Review** - Why semantic patterns beat traditional linting
3. **Building with LLMs** - Lessons from shipping Guardian MVP in production

<Callout type="warning" title="Why This Matters">
AI assistants can generate code 10x faster, but without governance, you're building technical debt 10x faster too. Guardian ensures your AI-generated code follows your team's patterns from day one.
</Callout>

## The Challenge We're Solving

Modern AI tools like Claude Code are incredibly powerful, but they come with a hidden cost: **context explosion**. Without Cortex TMS, your AI assistant reads:

- Old documentation nobody maintains
- Deprecated code paths
- Irrelevant test fixtures
- Configuration for platforms you don't use

Result? **Higher costs, slower responses, worse suggestions.**

<Terminal language="typescript">
// Without Cortex TMS
const context = await readEverything() // 66,834 tokens
const cost = calculateCost(context)    // $0.20 per query

// With Cortex TMS tiered memory
const context = await readHotTier()    // 3,647 tokens
const cost = calculateCost(context)    // $0.01 per query
const savings = "94.5% reduction"      // ✨
</Terminal>

<Callout type="tip" title="Token Savings Explained">
Cortex TMS uses a **tiered memory system** (HOT/WARM/COLD) to give AI only what it needs:

- **HOT** (Active): Current work context - AI reads this
- **WARM** (Truth): Documentation, patterns - On-demand only
- **COLD** (Archive): Old code, deprecated files - Ignored

Smart context = better AI suggestions at 10x lower cost.
