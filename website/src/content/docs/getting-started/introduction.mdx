## What Problem Does Cortex TMS Solve?

When working with AI coding assistants like **Claude Code** or **GitHub Copilot**, you quickly discover a challenge: these tools are brilliant at understanding code, but they struggle when your project documentation is:

- **Scattered** across README files, wikis, and Notion docs
- **Outdated** because manual updates fell behind code changes
- **Unstructured** in ways AI agents can't easily parse
- **Inconsistent** in format and conventions

**Cortex TMS solves this** by scaffolding a documentation structure that AI agents are designed to read, understand, and maintain.

## Core Philosophy: Truth-Driven Documentation

Traditional documentation fails because it's **manually maintained**. Cortex TMS introduces a different model:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Every piece of information lives in exactly one place
2. **Automated Validation**: The CLI verifies documentation matches reality
3. **AI-Optimized Format**: Files use conventions AI agents naturally understand
4. **Zero-Drift Architecture**: Changes to code trigger documentation updates

Think of it as **infrastructure-as-code, but for your project's knowledge**.

## Key Components

Cortex TMS scaffolds these core files:

### CLAUDE.md
Instructions that Claude Code reads automatically when opening your project. Defines:
- Your development workflow
- Git commit conventions
- Testing requirements
- Architecture guidelines

### NEXT-TASKS.md
The **current objective** for you and your AI assistant. Unlike sprawling TODO lists, this focuses on:
- What's being worked on **right now**
- Why it matters
- Acceptance criteria

### docs/adr/
**Architecture Decision Records** (ADRs) documenting:
- Why you chose technology X over Y
- What trade-offs were considered
- When the decision was made

### docs/core/PATTERNS.md
**Code conventions** AI agents should follow:
- Naming conventions
- File structure patterns
- Component design guidelines

### docs/core/GLOSSARY.md
**Shared vocabulary** preventing confusion:
- Domain-specific terms
- Acronyms and abbreviations
- Project-specific jargon

## How AI Agents Use These Files

When you ask Claude Code to "add authentication," here's what happens:

1. **Reads CLAUDE.md** to understand your workflow (e.g., "create a Git branch first")
2. **Checks PATTERNS.md** to follow your naming conventions
3. **Reviews GLOSSARY.md** to use correct terminology
4. **Updates NEXT-TASKS.md** to track progress
5. **Creates an ADR** to document the authentication approach chosen

Without Cortex TMS, Claude would make assumptions. With it, Claude follows **your team's conventions**.

## Who Should Use Cortex TMS?

### Perfect For:
- **Solo developers** using Claude Code or Copilot daily
- **Small teams** adopting AI-assisted development
- **Open source projects** onboarding AI-powered contributors
- **Educators** teaching LLM-augmented workflows

### Not Ideal For:
- Projects with no AI tooling (use traditional docs)
- Teams committed to separate documentation sites (Cortex TMS focuses on in-repo docs)
- Highly regulated industries requiring specific doc formats
