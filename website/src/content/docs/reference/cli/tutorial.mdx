The `cortex-tms tutorial` command provides an interactive onboarding experience. It teaches the "Cortex Way" through 5 progressive lessons covering the core workflows and tools.

## Synopsis

```bash
cortex-tms tutorial
```

## Description

**Learn by Doing**. The tutorial is a 10-15 minute interactive walkthrough that teaches Cortex TMS concepts through hands-on examples. Think of it as `vimtutor` for documentation architecture.

**What you'll learn**:
- How to read the status dashboard
- How to activate AI agents with prompts
- How zero-drift governance prevents documentation errors
- How validation catches issues early
- How migration safely evolves templates

**Format**:
- 5 progressive lessons
- Interactive navigation (Next/Previous/Exit)
- Try-this-command suggestions
- Pro tips for each concept

**Typical usage**:
```bash
# First time with Cortex TMS?
cortex-tms tutorial

# Interactive lessons appear
# Navigate with arrow keys
# Exit anytime (progress saved)
```

<Aside type="tip" title="New Team Members">
Have new developers run the tutorial before their first commit. It teaches the workflow in 15 minutes and prevents common mistakes.
</Aside>

## Options

**None**. The tutorial takes no flags or arguments. It's always interactive.

**Why no options?**
- Tutorial is meant to be experiential
- Interactive format is core to learning
- Non-interactive tutorial defeats the purpose

**If you need non-interactive docs**: Read the [concepts](/concepts/) section of the documentation instead.

## Lesson Structure

### Lesson 1: The Project Dashboard

**Topic**: Using `cortex-tms status` for project orientation

**Concepts taught**:
- Status dashboard sections (Identity, Health, Sprint, Backlog)
- Interpreting progress bars
- Understanding scope emojis (Nano 🔬, Standard 📦, Enterprise 🏢)
- Quick actions from dashboard

**Try-this-command**:
```bash
cortex-tms status
```

**Pro tip**:
> Run this command whenever you return to a project to get oriented.

📊 Lesson 1: The Project Dashboard

Lesson 1 of 5

Every Cortex TMS project has a visual dashboard showing:
  • Current scope (Nano/Standard/Enterprise)
  • Active tasks from NEXT-TASKS.md
  • Validation health status
  • Quick statistics at a glance

Think of this as your "Project Cockpit" - everything you
need to know in one command.

💻 Try this command:

   cortex-tms status

💡 Pro Tip: Run this command whenever you return to a
project to get oriented.

### Lesson 2: AI Agent Activation

**Topic**: Using `cortex-tms prompt` for AI workflows

**Concepts taught**:
- The "Essential 7" prompt library
- Project-aware prompts vs generic prompts
- Clipboard auto-copy workflow
- Customizing prompts in `PROMPTS.md`

**Prompts covered**:
- `init-session` - Start with context
- `feature` - Implement with architectural anchors
- `debug` - Troubleshoot systematically
- `review` - Code review against patterns
- `refactor` - Structural improvements
- `decision` - Architecture decision records
- `finish` - Execute maintenance protocol

**Try-this-command**:
```bash
cortex-tms prompt init-session
```

**Pro tip**:
> Customize prompts by editing `PROMPTS.md` in your project root.

---

### Lesson 3: Zero-Drift Governance

**Topic**: Version syncing and drift prevention

**Concepts taught**:
- What is documentation drift
- Single Source of Truth (package.json version)
- Automated version sync workflow
- CI validation enforcement

**How it works**:
1. Update `package.json` version (Single Source of Truth)
2. Run sync script (`pnpm run docs:sync`)
3. All docs automatically updated with new version
4. CI validates sync on every PR

**Try-this-command**:
```bash
pnpm run docs:sync
```

**Pro tip**:
> If CI blocks your PR, run `docs:sync` locally and commit the changes.

---

### Lesson 4: Project Health & Archive Protocol

**Topic**: Using `cortex-tms validate` for quality enforcement

**Concepts taught**:
- Validation checks (files, schemas, size limits, placeholders)
- Archive Protocol (why more than 10 completed tasks triggers CI failure)
- Keeping `NEXT-TASKS.md` focused on current work
- Governance that enforces itself

**Validation checks**:
- Mandatory files exist
- No placeholder text (e.g., `[YOUR_PROJECT]`)
- Configuration is valid (`.cortexrc`)
- Archive status healthy (fewer than 10 completed tasks in NEXT-TASKS.md)

**Archive Protocol explained**:
- CI blocks PRs if more than 10 completed tasks in `NEXT-TASKS.md`
- Forces regular archival to `docs/archive/`
- Keeps `NEXT-TASKS.md` focused on current work (1-2 weeks max)
- Prevents technical debt accumulation
- Governance enforces itself automatically

**Try-this-command**:
```bash
cortex-tms validate --strict
```

**Pro tip**:
> Run validate before commits to catch issues early.

---

### Lesson 5: Safe Template Evolution

**Topic**: Using `cortex-tms migrate` for upgrades

**Concepts taught**:
- Template evolution without fear
- Safe-Fail Migration Engine components
- Backup, Apply, Rollback workflow
- OUTDATED vs CUSTOMIZED file detection

**Three components**:

**1. Backup Engine (automatic snapshots)**:
- Timestamped backups in `.cortex/backups/`
- Created BEFORE any changes
- Manifest tracks what/why

**2. Apply Logic (smart upgrades)**:
- Auto-upgrades OUTDATED files (unchanged from old template)
- Skips CUSTOMIZED files (unless `--force`)
- Clear status reporting

**3. Rollback Command (one-click recovery)**:
- Interactive backup selection
- Preview before restore
- Confirmation required

**Try-this-command**:
```bash
cortex-tms migrate
```

**Pro tip**:
> Always run migrate (no flags) first to see what needs updating.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: New Developer Onboarding

**Context**: Developer just joined team, knows Git but not Cortex TMS

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Step 1: Watch tutorial
cortex-tms tutorial
# 15 minutes, learn all core concepts

# Step 2: Explore project
cortex-tms status
# See current sprint: "User Authentication"

# Step 3: Read documentation
cat NEXT-TASKS.md
cat docs/core/PATTERNS.md

# Step 4: Pick first task
cortex-tms prompt feature
# Paste into AI, ask: "Implement JWT token generation"

# Step 5: Validate before commit
cortex-tms validate --strict

# Developer now productive on Day 1
```

---

### Scenario: Quarterly Template Upgrade

**Context**: Team upgrades Cortex TMS quarterly, needs migration training

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Step 1: Review migration lesson
cortex-tms tutorial
# Navigate to Lesson 5
# Read about backup/apply/rollback

# Step 2: Check migration status
cortex-tms migrate
# See OUTDATED files

# Step 3: Apply upgrade
cortex-tms migrate --apply
# Backup created automatically

# Step 4: Review changes
git diff

# Step 5: If issues, rollback
cortex-tms migrate --rollback
# Select backup to restore

# Team understands migration safety
```

---

### Scenario: Documentation Quality Review

**Context**: Manager wants to ensure team follows TMS practices

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Step 1: Review validation lesson
cortex-tms tutorial
# Navigate to Lesson 4
# Learn Archive Protocol

# Step 2: Validate project
cortex-tms validate --strict

# Step 3: Check status
cortex-tms status
# See health metrics

# Step 4: Enforce practices
# Add to CI pipeline:
# - cortex-tms validate --strict
# - Block PRs if validation fails

# Team self-enforces quality
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tutorial Won't Start (Non-Interactive Terminal)

**Problem**: Running in CI/CD or non-TTY environment

**Error**:
```
Error: Tutorial requires interactive terminal
Use --help for documentation
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Tutorial requires TTY
# Run locally, not in CI

# For CI, use commands directly:
cortex-tms status
cortex-tms validate
```

---

### Terminal Display Issues

**Problem**: Formatting looks wrong, emojis not rendering

**Causes**:
- Old terminal emulator
- Missing emoji font
- Terminal width too narrow

**Solutions**:

**1. Use modern terminal**:
- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Windows Terminal (Windows)
- Gnome Terminal (Linux)

**2. Install emoji font**:
```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji

# macOS (built-in)
```

**3. Widen terminal**:
```bash
# Ensure at least 80 columns
resize -s 24 80
```

---

### Accidentally Exited Tutorial

**Problem**: Closed terminal mid-tutorial

**Current behavior**: Progress lost, restart from Lesson 1

**Workaround**: Tutorial is short, just re-run
```bash
cortex-tms tutorial
# Start over (15 min)
```

---

### Can't Navigate Back to Previous Lesson

**Problem**: "← Previous Lesson" option not showing

**Cause**: On Lesson 1 (no previous lesson exists)

**Solution**: Use "→ Next Lesson" to proceed forward
