## What is Cortex TMS?

Cortex TMS is a **CLI tool for scaffolding AI-optimized project documentation**. It creates the perfect environment for AI coding agents like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot to understand your codebase, maintain consistency, and prevent documentation drift.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Drift Governance**: Automated validation ensures your documentation always matches reality. No more outdated ADRs or forgotten task lists.
- **LLM-Optimized Structure**: Documentation organized exactly how AI agents expect it—parseable, hierarchical, and semantic.
- **Instant Setup**: One command to scaffold your entire project structure with best practices baked in.
- **Open Source & Extensible**: MIT licensed with template system for custom workflows and project types.

## Quick Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g cortex-tms@2.6.0

# Or use with npx (no installation required)
npx cortex-tms@2.6.0 init
```

## Key Features

- **Claude Code Integration**: Built-in `CLAUDE.md` instructions that Claude Code reads automatically
- **Task Management**: NEXT-TASKS.md for tracking current objectives with AI agents
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADR templates for documenting "why" decisions were made
- **Pattern Library**: PATTERNS.md for codifying conventions that AI can follow
- **Automated Validation**: CLI commands to verify documentation health

## Who Is This For?

- **Solo developers** using AI coding assistants
- **Teams** collaborating with LLM-augmented workflows
- **Open source maintainers** onboarding AI-powered contributors
- **Educators** teaching AI-assisted development practices
