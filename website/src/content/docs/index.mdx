## The Problem

AI coding assistants struggle when your documentation is scattered, outdated, or formatted for humans instead of LLMs. They hallucinate conventions, reinvent patterns you've already established, and drift from your architectural decisions.

**Cortex TMS solves this.** It scaffolds a project structure that AI agents can parse, navigate, and trust—keeping your codebase and its documentation in perfect sync.

<Aside type="tip" title="Built Using Our Own Standard">
  **We dogfood everything.** This project uses Cortex TMS to build itself—our `NEXT-TASKS.md` tracks development, our `PATTERNS.md` guides AI collaboration, and our Guardian CLI reviews every commit.

  Every feature is battle-tested on Cortex TMS before release. [See how we build →](/community/about/)

## Quick Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g cortex-tms@2.6.0

# Or use with npx (no installation required)
npx cortex-tms@2.6.0 init
```

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Zero-Drift Governance" icon="approve-check">
    Automated validation ensures your documentation always matches reality. No more outdated ADRs or forgotten task lists. The CLI continuously checks for drift and alerts you when documentation needs updating.
  </Card>

  <Card title="LLM-Optimized Structure" icon="seti:config">
    Documentation organized exactly how AI agents expect it—parseable, hierarchical, and semantic. Every file has a defined purpose, location, and format that LLMs can reliably consume.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Instant Setup" icon="rocket">
    One command to scaffold your entire project structure with best practices baked in. From task management to architectural decision records, everything is configured and ready to use.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Open Source & Extensible" icon="open-book">
    MIT licensed with a powerful template system for custom workflows and project types. Extend Cortex TMS to match your team's unique processes and requirements.
  </Card>
