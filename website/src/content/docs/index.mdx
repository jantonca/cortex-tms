## The Problem

AI coding assistants struggle when your documentation is scattered, outdated, or formatted for humans instead of LLMs. They hallucinate conventions, reinvent patterns you've already established, and drift from your architectural decisions.

**Cortex TMS solves this.** It scaffolds a project structure that AI agents can parse, navigate, and trust—keeping your codebase and its documentation in perfect sync.

---

## Quick Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g cortex-tms@2.6.0

# Or use with npx (no installation required)
npx cortex-tms@2.6.0 init
```

---

## Key Features

### Zero-Drift Governance
Automated validation ensures your documentation always matches reality. No more outdated ADRs or forgotten task lists. The CLI continuously checks for drift and alerts you when documentation needs updating.

### LLM-Optimized Structure
Documentation organized exactly how AI agents expect it—parseable, hierarchical, and semantic. Every file has a defined purpose, location, and format that LLMs can reliably consume.

### Instant Setup
One command to scaffold your entire project structure with best practices baked in. From task management to architectural decision records, everything is configured and ready to use.

### Open Source & Extensible
MIT licensed with a powerful template system for custom workflows and project types. Extend Cortex TMS to match your team's unique processes and requirements.
